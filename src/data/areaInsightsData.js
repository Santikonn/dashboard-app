  { idArea: 1, area: "Quality", title: "Close the Loop", comment: "The main opportunity is closing the loop — stable assignments, impact tracking, and targeted action — not increasing audit volume." },

  // 🟡 TRAINING (ID 2)
  { idArea: 2, area: "Training", title: "Stable Execution Baseline", comment: "Training has a stable execution baseline that allows interpreter onboarding and waves to run consistently." },
